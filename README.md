# ws4channels

A Dockerized Node.js application to stream WeatherStar 4000 data into Channels DVR using Puppeteer and FFmpeg.

## Prerequisites

- 850MB availabe RAM
- Docker installed
- WS4KP running and installed
   https://github.com/netbymatt/ws4kp
  
## Usage

Build and run the container:

Step 1: Pull the Docker Image

```bash

docker pull ghcr.io/rice9797/ws4channels:latest
```

Step 2: Run the Container

Next, run the container using the following command. This will start the container in detached mode and set the required environment variables.

```bash

docker run -d \
  --name ws4channels \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --memory="1096m" \
  --cpus="1.0" \
  -p 9798:9798 \
  -e PERMALINK_URL=your_permalink_generated_from_ws4kp \
  -e ZIP_CODE=your_zip_code \
  -e WS4KP_HOST=ws4kp_host \
  -e WS4KP_PORT=ws4kp_port \
http://ghcr.io/rice9797/ws4channels:latest
```

Example:

 --memory="1096m" --cpus="1.0" -p 9798:9798 -e ZIP_CODE=63101 -e WS4KP_PORT=8080 -e WS4KP_HOST=192.168.1.152

-1096m=the amount of maximum ram the container can use in mb. 

-1.0= maximum amount of cpu cores the container can use. Default is 1 core

-PERMALINK_URL=  Add if you created a permalink within ws4kp, delete this variable if not.

-63101= enter your zip code

-WS4KP_PORT= this is the port you set up WeatherStar4000 container with if you didn’t choose another port that container defaults to 8080.

-WS4KP_HOST= the ip of the machine that WeatherStar4000 container runs on.
